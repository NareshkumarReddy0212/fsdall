Experiment 5(c): Integrate MySQL with Spring Boot using Spring JDBC
Aim
To integrate a MySQL database with a Spring Boot application using Spring JDBC for performing CRUD operations.
Theory
Spring JDBC provides a simplified approach to interact with databases using JdbcTemplate.


Procedure / Steps

1.	Install JDK, Spring Tool Suite (STS), and MySQL Server.
2.	Open STS → New → Spring Starter Project.
3.	Add dependencies: Spring Web, Spring JDBC, MySQL Driver.
4.	Configure MySQL credentials in application.properties.
5.	Create Student model class with required fields and getters/setters.
6.	Create DAO class using JdbcTemplate for database interaction.
7.	Create REST controller to expose endpoints for CRUD operations.
8.	Run the Spring Boot application and test endpoints in Postman.


Source Code / SQL Commands

spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/college
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=yourpassword
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver


Expected Output
Application should connect successfully to MySQL and allow data insertion, retrieval, update, and deletion through REST endpoints.
Result
Spring Boot application successfully connected to MySQL using Spring JDBC and performed CRUD operations.
