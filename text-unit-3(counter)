Experiment (d): Use Redux to Manage State in a Counter App
Redux provides a centralized way to manage and update state in React applications. It is particularly useful when multiple components share or depend on the same state. In this experiment, students will create a simple counter application using Redux Toolkit and React Redux to understand the principles of state management.
Aim:
To use Redux Toolkit and React Redux to implement a counter app.
Tools Required:
• Node.js (LTS version) – https://nodejs.org/
• Visual Studio Code – https://code.visualstudio.com/
• Web browser (Google Chrome recommended)
Procedure:
1. Install Redux Toolkit and React Redux using the command:
   npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
2. Inside the src directory, create a new folder named store to organize Redux files.
3. Create src/store/counterSlice.js to define reducers for increment, decrement, and reset actions using createSlice().
4. Create src/store/store.js and configure the Redux store with the counter reducer.
5. In src/index.js, wrap the App component with the Provider component from react-redux and pass the store to it.
6. Create src/components/Counter.js to connect React components with Redux using useSelector and useDispatch hooks.
7. Render the Counter component in App.js and verify that all buttons work correctly.


Source Code:

counterSlice.js:

import { createSlice } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";

const counterSlice = createSlice({
  name: "counter",
  initialState: { value: 0 },
  reducers: {
    increment: (state) => { state.value += 1; },
    decrement: (state) => { state.value -= 1; },
    reset: (state) => { state.value = 0; }
  }
});

export const { increment, decrement, reset } = counterSlice.actions;
export default counterSlice.reducer;
store.js:
import { configureStore } from "@reduxjs/toolkit";
import counterReducer from "./counterSlice";

export const store = configureStore({
  reducer: {
    counter: counterReducer
  }
});

index.js:

import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import App from "./App";
import { Provider } from "react-redux";
import { store } from "./store/store";

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
<Provider store={store}>
<App />
</Provider>
);

Counter.js:

import React from "react";
import { useSelector, useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { increment, decrement, reset } from "../store/counterSlice";

export default function Counter() {
  const value = useSelector((state) => state.counter.value);
  const dispatch = useDispatch();

  return (
<div style={{ padding: 20 }}>
<h2>Redux Counter Example</h2>
<h3>Counter Value: {value}</h3>
<button onClick={() => dispatch(increment())}>+1</button>{" "}
<button onClick={() => dispatch(decrement())}>-1</button>{" "}
<button onClick={() => dispatch(reset())}>Reset</button>
</div>
  );
}

App.js:

import React from "react";
import Counter from "./components/Counter";

export default function App() {
  return (
<div>
<h1>React + Redux Counter Application</h1>
<Counter />
</div>
  );
}
Explanation:
• Redux Toolkit's createSlice() simplifies the process of creating reducers and actions in one place.
• The configureStore() method creates a centralized store that holds the entire app’s state.
• The Provider component from react-redux makes the store available to all React components.
• useSelector() reads data from the Redux store.
• useDispatch() sends actions to update the store.
• The counter's value is globally managed, allowing consistent updates across components.
Expected Output:
The counter app displays a number (initially 0) along with three buttons: +1, -1, and Reset. Clicking '+1' increments the count, '-1' decrements it, and 'Reset' sets the count back to 0. The state is managed centrally in the Redux store and updates reflect immediately on the UI.
Result:
The counter application was successfully implemented using Redux Toolkit and React Redux. The experiment demonstrates how to manage global application state, dispatch actions, and subscribe to store updates in React.
