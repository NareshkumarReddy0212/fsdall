Experiment (e): Use Maven to Build, Package, and Run the Spring Boot Application
This experiment demonstrates how to use Apache Maven to build, package, and execute a Spring Boot application. Maven automates the build lifecycle and manages dependencies, ensuring consistent and reproducible project builds.
Aim:
To use Maven to build, package, and run a Spring Boot application efficiently with dependency management and build automation.
Tools Required:
• JDK 17 or later – https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html
• Apache Maven – https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
• Spring Boot – https://start.spring.io/
• IDE – IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / Spring Tool Suite (STS)
• Command Line / Terminal – for Maven commands
Theory:
Maven is a powerful build automation tool for Java projects. It uses a Project Object Model (POM) defined in the pom.xml file to manage dependencies, build processes, and packaging. Maven provides lifecycle phases such as clean, compile, package, install, and deploy.

Key Maven lifecycle phases:
• clean – Removes previous build files
• compile – Compiles Java source code
• package – Packages the compiled code into a JAR/WAR
• install – Installs the package into the local repository
• deploy – Deploys the package to a remote repository

In Spring Boot, Maven also manages framework dependencies and can directly run applications using 'mvn spring-boot:run'.


Procedure:
1. Open https://start.spring.io/ and create a new Maven project.
2. Choose Java as the language, select Spring Boot 3.x or higher, and add the dependency 'Spring Web'.
3. Click 'Generate' to download the project ZIP, then extract and open it in your IDE.
4. Observe the folder structure of the generated project.
5. Edit the pom.xml file to verify Spring Boot dependencies are included.
6. Create a controller class 'HelloController.java' in the package 'com.example.demo.controller'.
7. Run Maven commands in terminal: clean, compile, package, and spring-boot:run.
8. Navigate to the target folder to find the packaged JAR file.
9. Execute the JAR file using 'java -jar target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar'.
10. Open http://localhost:8080 in a web browser to see the output.
Project Folder Structure:
myapp/
┣ src/
┃ ┣ main/
┃ ┃ ┣ java/ → Java source code
┃ ┃ ┗ resources/ → configuration and static files
┣ pom.xml → Maven project configuration

Sample pom.xml snippet:
<dependencies>
<dependency>
<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
</dependency>
</dependencies>


Source Code:

HelloController.java:
package com.example.demo.controller;

import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class HelloController {
    @GetMapping("/")
    public String greet() {
        return "Hello, Spring Boot with Maven!";
    }
}

DemoApplication.java:

package com.example.demo;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class DemoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}


Common Maven Commands:
• mvn clean – Cleans the project by deleting the target directory.
• mvn compile – Compiles the Java source files.
• mvn package – Packages the project into a JAR/WAR.
• mvn spring-boot:run – Runs the Spring Boot application directly.


Expected Output:
When you open http://localhost:8080, the browser displays:
Hello, Spring Boot with Maven!

The terminal also shows logs such as:
Tomcat started on port 8080
Started DemoApplication in 2.345 seconds
Result:
The Spring Boot application was successfully built, packaged, and executed using Maven. Students understood the Maven lifecycle, dependency management, and executable JAR creation process.
